# Snkr

Snkr is a RESTful fullstack web app inspired by Nike SNKRS that I created to develop my designer and fullstack development skills using the NEMO stack (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Other Stuff). 

## Development Status

Snkr is currently under development for deployment.

## Planned features

* Password reset
* Image upload with multer and cloudinary
* Listing locations with Mapbox
* Fuzzy search
* Favoriting 
* Pagination

## Tech/framework used

**Built with**

* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB 
* Ejs
* Passport.js
* Cloudinary

## Setup Up

To run this project, install the latest version of MongoDB and make sure all the dependencies are installed using npm, then run 

$ node App.js

You should get a message saying "Roomly server has connected!" and you can view the application through your browser with localhost. 

Thats it !
